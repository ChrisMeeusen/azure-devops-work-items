#### Description
The purpose of this package is to provide you with a commit git hook that will conveniently show you a list of work items 
that are in your team's current sprint.

#### Install
Todo hook install instructions here.

<a name="settings" />

#### Settings
There is a little setup required the first time you use this hook, but once you input your settings the hook will store them and use them 
in all future runs.  Default and Repo are the two setting types.  Repo settings take precedence over default settings. Default settings are like global settings.  A particular default setting value will be used
if it isn't overridden by a repo setting.
